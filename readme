This repository contains components of the factandfiction website. The website is my final project for CS50.  The contents are made up of the primary php components of the website. The php components are seperated in three folders: includes, public, and templates.  The includes component contains various files of php functions used by the internet facing php modules in the public folder.  The templates folder contains files that are rendered as html pages at the request of the internet facing modules in the public folder.
